# Made For You

## Description

This project was created to demonstrate skills learned in Flatiron School's Software Development program.
The project is developed with a React frontend and a Rails API. 



## Background
Giving gifts is a fundamental part of human behavior that can be traced back to the very beginnings of recorded time. As with most of our traditions, it continues to evolve with each passing year. While most of us enjoy gift giving to show love, appreciation or support, we may find ourselves wondering if the increasing pressure to spend more and more money on gifts is true to the origins of this custom. This is why giving homemade gifts has become more and more popular in recent times.
However, coming up with and making a homemade gift may sound like a daunting task, so this is an app that allows members to view and share homemade gift ideas.


See Environment Setup below for instructions on installing these tools if you
don't already have them.


## Feature Highlights
